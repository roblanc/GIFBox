# GIFBox

A clever, cheeky box of GIFs. This is a simple web application for storing and browsing a collection of GIFs, built with Next.js and React.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/GIFbox.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

Here are the key files and folders in the project:

- `public/gifs/`: This is where all the GIF files are stored. You can create subdirectories to organize your GIFs by category.
- `data/gifs.json`: This file contains the metadata for all the GIFs that are displayed on the website. It is automatically generated by a script.
- `src/app/page.tsx`: This is the main page of the application.
- `scripts/update-gifs.mjs`: This is a script that scans the `public/gifs` directory and updates the `data/gifs.json` file.

## Managing GIFs

To add, remove, or rename GIFs, you should modify the contents of the `public/gifs` directory. After making changes, you need to run a script to update the `data/gifs.json` file.

1.  Add, remove, or rename GIF files in the `public/gifs` directory. You can create subdirectories to categorize your GIFs.
2.  Run the following command to update the `gifs.json` file:

    ```sh
    npm run update-gifs
    ```

This will automatically update the website with your changes.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `.next` directory.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
